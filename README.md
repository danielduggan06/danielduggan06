- Hi, I’m Dan Duggan
- I’m currently studying for my AZ-104 Certification, while working as an IT Security Operations Analyst at Citibank.
- I've enrolled in a program to receive my Master's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Security.
- I am currently trying to learn multiple different languages, but taking a project/solutions-based approach instead of focusing on one specific language.
